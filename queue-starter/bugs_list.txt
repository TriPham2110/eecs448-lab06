1. peekFront might be peeking at the back since we have m_back pointer in "Queue.h"
2. if peekFront is correctly peeking at the front, then enqueue might be adding item like stack's push
3. dequeue is not removing the front of the queue (potentially removing the back of the queue like stack's pop)
4. valgrind runs fine (since I kept track of every enqueue and dequeue), but I do not think that guarantees the queue's destructor to be correctly defined
